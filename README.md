# CS160_CQ7

runningTime.java analysis:
Time complexity = 0(n) due to the for loop going from 1 to the problem size and all the constant work within the for loop
Space complexity = 0(1) due to nothing being saved into memory really other than the shifts

iceCreamParlor:
Base case: One solution to the problem when there are no icecreams
"recursive def." = for all elements less than m, get the complement and add on
*do have to admit i'm not 100% sure how i'm correct.
